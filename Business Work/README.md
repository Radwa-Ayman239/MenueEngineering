📄 File Contributions

The files in this folder represent the strategic foundation of the FlavorCraft solution. Here is how your work in these files contributes to the project:



1\. deliotte hakathon.docx — The Strategy \& Solution Design

This document contains the answers to the "Guided Questions" and the core strategy you developed. It serves as the project's Analytical Playbook:



Menu Engineering Strategy: Your specific recommendations on how to handle Stars, Plowhorses, Puzzles, and Dogs (e.g., simulating 5% price shifts for Plowhorses).



Customer Segmentation: The 8-persona framework you built (from VIP Whales to At-Risk) to provide targeted business actions.



Upsell Methodology: The specific "Support" and "Confidence" logic you established to create the "Upsell Map" for staff training.



Proprietary Findings: Documentation of your "Description Paradox" discovery (how shorter descriptions drive higher volume).

2\. FlavorCraft Optimizer Business Model.pdf — The Commercial Architecture

This document takes your strategic solutions and turns them into a Viable Business:



Value Proposition: Summarizes the solutions you designed into a clear promise: "Increased profitability and reduced waste through data."



Revenue Streams: Outlines how the strategy will be sold (One-time audits vs. Subscription-based dashboards).



Partnership Roadmap: Identifies the collaborators (POS providers/Food distributors) needed to execute the strategy you proposed.
