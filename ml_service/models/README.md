# Models Directory

This directory is no longer used for ML model files.

The menu item classification (Star/Plowhorse/Puzzle/Dog) is now handled
by the Django backend using the Menu Engineering Matrix algorithm.

See: `backend/menu/menu_classifier.py`

The ML service is now focused only on AI-powered features using OpenRouter/DeepSeek.
